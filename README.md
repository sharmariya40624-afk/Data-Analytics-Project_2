# Superstore Sales Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyse Superstore sales data using Excel and develop an
interactive dashboard to understand sales performance across product categories, sub- categories, regions, customer segments, and time periods. ## Dataset Description
The Superstore dataset contains retail transaction data including order details, product
categories, customer segments, regional information, sales, profit, and discount values. The
dataset is used to explore trends, patterns, and anomalies that can support business
decision-making. ## Data Structure
Key variables used in the analysis include: - Order Date (Date) - Category and Sub-Category (Categorical) - Sales (Numerical) - Region and Segment (Categorical)
## Exploratory Questions
1. Which product categories generate the highest sales?
2. Which sub-categories contribute the most to total sales?
3. Which region contributes the most to total sales?
4. Which customer segment generates the highest sales?
5. What overall insights can be derived from the sales dashboard?
## Methodology
Pivot tables and charts were created in Microsoft Excel to explore relationships between
sales, profit, discounts, regions, and customer segments. Time-based analysis was
performed using derived month and year fields. Visualizations were used to support pattern
identification and assumption validation. ## Key Findings
- Technology shows the highest sales, with Office Supplies performing consistently well. - Sales are concentrated in a few sub-categories, mainly from Technology and Office Supplies, while several sub-categories show relatively low sales.
- The West region contributes the highest sales, followed by the East and Central regions, while the South region shows comparatively lower sales. - The Consumer segment contributes the majority of sales, followed by the Corporate
segment, whereas the Home Office segment has the lowest sales contribution. - The dashboard shows that sales performance is mainly driven by the Technology category, the Consumer segment, and strong regional performance in the West, with clear seasonal
trends over time. ## Data Issues and Observations
- Profit and cost data are not available, limiting analysis to sales only. - Returns and cancellations are not included. - Sales are mainly driven by the Technology category. - Monthly sales show seasonal fluctuations. ## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Dashboard) - GitHub (Version Control and Documentation)
## Conclusion
The dashboard provides clear insights into sales performance across products, regions, customer segments, and time, supporting data-driven understanding of business trends.
